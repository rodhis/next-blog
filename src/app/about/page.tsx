                My name is Rodrigo, but I really like the nickname Rodhis, so you can call me that too! I&apos;m from Aba√≠ra,
                state of Bahia, Brazil, a very small but beautiful city that&apos;s part of the Chapada Diamantina region, with
                rich flora and fauna. You can visit me sometime!

                As a child, I have always liked technology and computers, especially if there were video games involved (lol). But
                life pushed me towards another direction, so my first profession was as a pharmacist.

                As life went on, during the pandemic, I had the need to do something else, and it had to be something I liked and
                could do at home. So I remembered my childhood, consulted with relatives, and started to study programming. Years
                later, with lots of bootcamps, free courses and an ongoing graduation, here I am, after lots of projects on GitHub,
                focusing on full-stack using NextJs, TypeScript, and Node.

                When I&apos;m not coding, I like to spend my time playing clarinet, which is inherited from my family. I also like
                to play video games, watch movies and series, and dedicate a good amount of time listening to music.

            <p>I&apos;m also a beer lover, so come drink a cold one with me! hehe</p>

                This website was part of a migration project from Next 10 pages router, in which I incremented with other stuff
                and decided to make it my personal blog, and, in the future, a portfolio of my projects. I hope you enjoy it! And
                please contact me for anything you want to talk about!
