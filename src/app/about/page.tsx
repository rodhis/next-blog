                My name is Rodrigo, but I really like the nickname Rodhis, so you can call me that too!
                I&apos;m from Aba√≠ra, state of Bahia, Brazil, a very small but beautiful city that&apos;s part
                of the Chapa Diamantina region, which rich flora and fauna. You can visit me sometime!

                As a child, I aways liked technology and computers, specially if there was videogames involved
                (lol). But life pushed me towards another direction, so my first profession was of a
                pharmacist.

                As life went on, during the pandemic, I had the need to do something else, and it had to me
                something I liked and could do at home. So I remembered my childhood, consulted with
                relatives, and started to study programming. Years after, with lots of bootcamps, free courses
                and an ongoing graduation, here I am, with lots of projects on GitHub, focusing on full-stack
                using NextJs, TypeScript and Node.

                When I&apos;m not coding, I like to spend my time playing clarinet, which is inherited from my
                family. I also like to play videogames, watch movies and series, and dedicate a good ammout of
                time listening to music.

            <p>I&apos;m also a beer lover, so come drink a cold one with me! hehe</p>

                This website was part of an migration project from Next 10 pages router, in which I
                incremented with other stuff and decided to make it my personal blog, and, in the future, a
                portfolio of my projects. I hope you enjoy it! And please contact me for anything you want to
                talk about!
