# HTML Basics

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page using markup. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.

## Basic Structure

An HTML document has a basic structure that includes the following elements:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

-   `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
-   `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.
-   `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document.
-   `<title>`: Sets the title of the HTML document.
-   `<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document.

## Common HTML Elements

### Headings

Headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags:

```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<h2>This is a subheading</h2>
```

### Paragraphs

Paragraphs are defined with the `<p>` tag:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

### Links

Links are defined with the `<a>` tag:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>
```

### Images

Images are defined with the `<img>` tag:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image" />
```

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

Unordered lists are defined with the `<ul>` tag, and list items are defined with the `<li>` tag:

```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

### Ordered Lists

Ordered lists are defined with the `<ol>` tag, and list items are defined with the `<li>` tag:

```html
<ol>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
</ol>
```

## Conclusion

HTML is the foundation of web development. Understanding its basic structure and elements is essential for creating web pages. Practice using different HTML tags to become more familiar with the language.
