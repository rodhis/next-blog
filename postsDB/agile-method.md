# Agile Methodology

## Introduction

Agile methodology is a project management and software development approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It is designed to accommodate changes and deliver high-quality products through iterative progress and continuous feedback.

## Key Principles

The Agile Manifesto outlines four core values:

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan.

## Agile Frameworks

Several frameworks implement Agile principles, including:

-   **Scrum**: Focuses on time-boxed iterations called sprints, with roles such as Scrum Master and Product Owner.
-   **Kanban**: Visualizes work items on a board, emphasizing continuous delivery and flow.
-   **Extreme Programming (XP)**: Enhances software quality through practices like pair programming and test-driven development.

## Benefits

-   **Flexibility**: Agile allows teams to adapt to changes quickly.
-   **Customer Satisfaction**: Continuous delivery of valuable software ensures customer needs are met.
-   **Improved Quality**: Regular testing and feedback loops enhance product quality.
-   **Team Collaboration**: Agile promotes a collaborative environment, improving team morale and productivity.

## Conclusion

Agile methodology is a powerful approach for managing projects and developing software. By embracing its principles and practices, teams can deliver high-quality products that meet customer needs and adapt to changing requirements.
